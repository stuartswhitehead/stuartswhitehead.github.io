				<h1>About</h1>

				<p class="about-text">
					I'm a front end developer with 5 years of professional experience creating performant and engaging user experiences. I love working directly with UX designers to rapidly prototype their ideas and then make it a reality in production code. I'm skilled in web development (HTML/CSS/Javascript/React) and native mobile development (Android and iOS), and I'm always willing to learn something new. I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech in 2013.

                            I've been creating prototypes for Watson Workspace since the project's inception. As the design team worked to define the product's features and experience, I prototyped their ideas so they could see it in action. Some of this work was passed along to the development team, while other pieces were experimentation for future concepts. Other prototypes were created to assist user research in testing ideas and gathering feedback.<br/><br/>

                            I also actively contribute to Workspace's iOS production code to ensure it matches our design team's vision. I focus on fixing visual defects to adjust not only fonts, colors, and sizings, but also the behavior and layout of the app for the best presentation possible.

As the prototype shows, the admin would be able to manage their users' permissions, features, and control other functions as they saw fit. The experience was created by a team of three UX designers. The intent was to hand off much of my code to the eventual development team, but work on the project was indefinitely put on hold in mid-May.

When the design team wanted to execute a major overhaul of the app's overall UI, I created a prototype exploring the new vision.<br/><br/>

                            The prototype brought several new ideas to life, including interesting animation and transition patterns. Afterwards, I worked as part of the product's development team to integrate some of the concepts into the production code.
